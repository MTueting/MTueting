I am a Econ Ph.D. student at the University of St.Gallen, Switzerland. 
My research is in the fields of economic geography, regional economics, and conflict with a focus on developing countries. 
I am passionate about the spatial distribution of economic activity and people. My research is dedicated to increasing our 
knowledge of how a country's general spatial equilibrium determines its regions' growth paths.

As a byproduct of my focus on developing countries, I often rely on satellite imagery or historic maps and constantly develop 
tools for spatial data generation or analysis. E.g., I developed an approach to combine map digitization and machine learning.
